# DJApp
Simple DJ App made with JUCE as a framework and C++ as a language. This app was made as part of a course in Object Oriented Programming.
To run, we must have the JUCE application installed and paste the files in a new app we create in JUCE.
The project has two components that allow us to play music, the third component is unfinished.
